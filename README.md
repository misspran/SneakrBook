SneakrBook
==========

FUUUUUU
1. As a user, I want to list friends whose sneakers I like
1 POINT START
The main screen of the app is a list of people who have sneakers I like.

These are my friends: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-makers-assets/app/public/ckeditor_assets/attachments/18/friends.json allow the user to choose which friends have sneakers they like

hint: the choice screen is a separate screen and should be segueâ€™d from the first screen!

hint: You don't have to prepopulate the Core Data database with this list this time (well you can, if you want extra work and want to manage a Like entity too). Instead create new Person entitties for each friend the user chooses.

Add at least two other attributes to your entities (i.e. shoe color, size, brand; person gender, height, etc.). When the user chooses a friend, show a viewController for them to fill in the other attributes.

step 2: as a user I want to view my friend's profile
